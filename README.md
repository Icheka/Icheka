<div style="text-align: center; color: red;">I love coding (who doesn't!?).</div>
But more than slapping my keyboard until green, red and gold colors streak beautifully across my screen, I enjoy building <i>stuff</i> &mdash; designing, coding, testing and deploying. <br />
Whenever I'm not assigned to one of the above-listed missions, I may be found running (11km in ~39mins is my record!), eating ice cream, or just reading sci-fi novels.

2022 promises to be a wonderful year for me!
